Hi I am Indrashis Manna this is our open CV project where we AIM to take use of deep learning for the purpose of OBJECT DETECTION and ROS implementation 


# Object Detection with OpenCV

This repository contains a Python class for object detection using a deep learning model with OpenCV. The `ObjectDetector` class encapsulates the functionality of loading a pre-trained deep learning model and performing object detection on input images.

## Features

- **Model Agnostic**: Supports various deep learning models for object detection.
- **Easy Integration**: Easily integrate object detection capabilities into your Python projects.
- **Flexible Preprocessing and Postprocessing**: Customize preprocessing and postprocessing steps to suit your specific needs.
- **Efficient Inference**: Leverage the efficiency of OpenCV for real-time object detection tasks.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/object-detection-opencv.git
   ```

2. **Model Setup**: Place your trained deep learning model file (e.g., `.pb`, `.weights`) in the `models` directory.

3. **Usage**: Import the `ObjectDetector` class in your Python code and use it to perform object detection.
   ```python
   from object_detector import ObjectDetector

   # Initialize the object detector with the path to the trained model
   detector = ObjectDetector(model_path='models/yolov3.pb')

   # Load the model
   detector.load_model()

   # Perform object detection on an input image
   detections = detector.detect_objects(image)
   ```

4. **Customization**: Customize preprocessing, postprocessing, and other parameters according to your requirements by modifying the `ObjectDetector` class methods.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Trained deep learning model file (e.g., `.pb`, `.weights`)
